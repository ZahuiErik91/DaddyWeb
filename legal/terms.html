                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> ("App"). The App is a personal project created and 
                    maintained by <strong>Zahui Varga Erik</strong> ("Developer"), an individual developer based 
                    in Romania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DaddyFreud is a self-help tool designed to support personal reflection, addiction recovery 
                    tracking, and providing AI-assisted perspectives. <strong>It is NOT a medical device, a 
                    licensed healthcare provider, or a crisis service.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do 
                    not agree, strictly do not use the App.
                </p>

                <h2>2. STRICT MEDICAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
                <p><strong>THE APP DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>No Doctor-Patient Relationship:</strong> Use of the App does not create a relationship between you and the Developer or the AI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not a Diagnosis:</strong> The AI output, logs, and tracking features are for informational and self-reflective purposes only. They cannot diagnose, treat, or cure any mental health condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Harm:</strong> If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, self-harm, or a medical emergency, <strong>call 112 (EU), 911 (US), or your local emergency number immediately.</strong> Do not rely on this App for crisis intervention.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>3. AI Technology & Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    The App uses Artificial Intelligence (LLMs) provided by third parties (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, 
                    Anthropic). By using the "AI Coach" or "Therapist Mode," you acknowledge:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Probabilistic Nature:</strong> AI generates responses based on patterns, not facts. It may "hallucinate" (invent false information) or provide advice that sounds plausible but is clinically incorrect.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Human Oversight (Generally):</strong> Most responses are generated automatically. However, see Section 3.4 below regarding human review.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Discretion:</strong> You are solely responsible for evaluating the accuracy and safety of any suggestion made by the App before acting on it.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3.4 Real-Time Corrections</h3>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that a response you receive in the chat may be edited or replaced in real-time by 
                    a human clinical reviewer. While we aim for clinical excellence, the Developer acts as a platform 
                    provider and is not responsible for the specific professional judgment of these independent reviewers.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Eligibility & Therapist Mode</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Use:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapist Mode:</strong> Access to "Therapist Mode" is restricted to verified professionals or students who have passed our competency checks. Use of this mode is subject to the additional <strong>Professional User Agreement</strong>. Falsely representing yourself as a clinician to access this mode is a material breach of these Terms and potential fraud.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. User Accounts & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The Developer reserves the right to suspend or delete your account immediately, without notice, if you violate these Terms, specifically regarding safety or abusive content.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                
                <h3>User Content & Model Training</h3>
                <p>You retain ownership of your personal journal entries. However, regarding Chat Interactions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You grant the Developer a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use your <strong>anonymized</strong> queries and interactions to improve the App, including training our AI models and creating the "Golden Dataset."</li>
                    <li>You understand that our "Therapist Mode" users may rewrite AI responses to you. You have no ownership rights over these corrected responses or the underlying clinical logic.</li>
                    <li>The Developer retains full ownership of all training data, models, and datasets derived from your anonymized interactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>App Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The interface, code, branding ("DaddyFreud"), and custom system prompts are the intellectual property 
                    of the Developer. You may not reverse-engineer the API or scrape the content.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Subscriptions & Refunds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merchant of Record:</strong> Payments are processed by Apple (App Store) or Stripe. The Developer does not store your credit card details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests must be made directly to the platform (e.g., Apple Support) and are subject to their policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the App to generate content that promotes self-harm, violence, or illegal acts.</li>
                    <li>Input "Protected Health Information" (PHI) of <em>other people</em> (e.g., if you are a therapist, do not paste your patient's real names or notes into the Chat).</li>
                    <li>Attempt to "jailbreak" the AI to bypass safety filters.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The Developer (Zahui Varga Erik) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or 
                    consequential damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, data, or 
                    <strong>emotional distress</strong>, arising out of your use of the App.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Developer's total liability to you for any claim is limited to the amount you paid to use 
                    the App in the past 12 months, or <strong>€50</strong>, whichever is greater.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>

                    These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Romania</strong>. Any dispute arising from

                        <strong>⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> This service utilizes Artificial Intelligence. 
                        You are interacting with a machine learning system, not a human therapist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, OR DANGER OF SELF-HARM, 
                        STOP USING THIS SERVICE IMMEDIATELY AND CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                <h2>1. Nature of Service: AI Companion</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> DaddyFreud is an Artificial Intelligence system. While our models are 
                    fine-tuned using data refined by mental health professionals ("Clinical Quality Analysts"), 
                    <strong>THE APP AUTOMATICALLY GENERATES RESPONSES WITHOUT REAL-TIME HUMAN OVERSIGHT.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>1.1 No Medical Advice</h3>
                <p>
                    The Service is for <strong>self-help and emotional tracking</strong>. It is not a replacement for 
                    professional therapy, medical diagnosis, or treatment.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 Human Training Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We employ clinical experts to grade and improve the AI's response quality. However, 
                    <strong>the response you receive in the chat is generated 100% by software, not by the expert directly.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>1.3 The "Clinical Engine" & Structured Guidance</h3>
                <p>
                    The App utilizes a rule-based system (the "<strong>Clinical Engine</strong>") to structure your conversation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Software States, Not Medical Stages:</strong> You may see terms in the debug logs or App structure such as "Intake," "Stabilization," or "Intervention." These refer strictly to <strong>software logic states</strong> (Finite State Machine phases) designed to organize the chatbot's responses. They do <strong>not</strong> constitute a medical intake, psychiatric stabilization, or clinical intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Crisis Detection:</strong> The App uses keyword detection (e.g., "S99_CRISIS" protocol) to identify potential safety risks. If specific distress keywords are detected, the App is programmed to <strong>automatically lock</strong> into a "Safety Mode" that provides standard resource links (e.g., 988, 112). This is an automated code execution, not a clinical decision made by a human doctor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1.4 Crisis Situations</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>The AI cannot physically assist you.</strong> If you are in danger of self-harm, suicide, 
                    or harming others, you must <strong>stop using the App immediately</strong> and contact emergency 
                    services (911 in US, 999 in UK, 112 in EU).
                </p>

                <h3>1.5 No Professional Relationship</h3>
                <p>
                    Your use of the Service does not create a doctor-patient, therapist-client, fiduciary, or 
                    confidential professional relationship between you and the Developer or the AI system.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Safety Protocols & Crisis Intervention</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Automated Safety Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    To comply with applicable safety regulations (including California Senate Bill 243), DaddyFreud 
                    employs automated systems designed to detect language indicative of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suicidal ideation or self-harm</li>
                    <li>Child abuse or exploitation</li>
                    <li>Imminent violence toward others</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Automated Response</h3>
                <p>If the system detects crisis language, it may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interrupt the conversation</li>
                    <li>Provide immediate, clickable resources for crisis hotlines</li>
                    <li>Temporarily suspend the account to prevent reinforcement of harmful patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 Limitation of Detection Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Natural Language Processing is not infallible. The system cannot 
                    guarantee detection of all crisis situations. You acknowledge that DaddyFreud has no liability 
                    related to the failure of the AI to identify a medical or mental health emergency.
                </p>

                <h2>3. AI Technology & Limitations</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Models</h3>
                <p>
                    The App uses Large Language Models (LLMs) provided by third parties (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, 
                    Anthropic, Google). These are Generative AI systems that create responses based on statistical patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 AI "Hallucinations" and Output Accuracy</h3>
                <p><strong>Critical Limitation:</strong> You understand that Generative AI technology is probabilistic and may produce "hallucinations"—information that sounds plausible but is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Factually incorrect</li>
                    <li>Nonsensical or contradictory</li>
                    <li>Unrelated to your query</li>
                    <li>Potentially harmful if acted upon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> You assume full responsibility for verifying the accuracy of 
                    any information, advice, or suggestions provided by the AI. DaddyFreud makes <strong>no warranty, 
                    express or implied</strong>, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the AI's output. 
                    Reliance on any information provided by the Service is solely at your own risk.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 No Human Oversight</h3>
                <p>
                    Most responses are generated automatically without human review. However, see Section 3.4 below 
                    regarding optional human review in certain circumstances.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Real-Time Corrections by Clinical Reviewers</h3>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that a response you receive may be edited or replaced in real-time by a human 
                    clinical reviewer if you flag it as unhelpful or unsafe. While we aim for clinical quality, the 
                    Developer acts as a platform provider and is not responsible for the specific professional judgment 
                    of these independent reviewers.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Eligibility & Therapist Mode</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Use:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapist Mode:</strong> Access to "Therapist Mode" is restricted to verified professionals or students who have passed our competency checks. Use of this mode is subject to the additional <strong>Professional User Agreement</strong>. Falsely representing yourself as a clinician to access this mode is a material breach of these Terms and potential fraud.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Anonymity and Data Loss</h2>
                
                <h3>5.1 Anonymous Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    We do not require an email or phone number to use the App. Your account is tied to a generated 
                    <strong>anonymous ID stored on your device's Keychain</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 Risk of Loss</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> If you lose your device, factory reset it without an iCloud/Google 
                        backup, or damage your Keychain data, <strong>WE CANNOT RECOVER YOUR ACCOUNT OR CHAT HISTORY</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You acknowledge this risk is the trade-off for complete anonymity.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>5.3 Account Termination</h3>
                <p>
                    The Developer reserves the right to suspend or delete your account immediately, without notice, 
                    if you violate these Terms, specifically regarding safety or abusive content.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                
                <h3>User Content & Model Training</h3>
                <p>You retain ownership of your personal journal entries. However, regarding Chat Interactions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You grant the Developer a license to use your <strong>anonymized</strong> queries and interactions to provide, maintain, and improve the App, including training and developing our AI models.</li>
                    <li>Our clinical reviewers may provide improved responses to help you. These improved responses and associated clinical insights become part of the App's knowledge base.</li>
                    <li>The Developer retains ownership of the App's AI models, algorithms, and anonymized training data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>App Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The interface, code, branding ("DaddyFreud"), and custom system prompts are the intellectual property 
                    of the Developer. You may not reverse-engineer the API or scrape the content.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Subscriptions and "Boost" Packs</h2>
                
                <h3>7.1 Auto-Renewing Subscription</h3>
                <p>
                    "Daddy+ Yearly" subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least <strong>24 hours before 
                    the end of the current period</strong> via your Apple ID/Google Play settings.
                </p>

                <h3>7.2 Consumable "Boost" Packs</h3>
                <p>
                    We offer one-time purchases (e.g., "Deep Dive", "Big Pack") that add chat credits to your account.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Boost Packs are "consumable" digital items. Once purchased and credits are added to your account, they <strong>cannot be refunded</strong>, even if you do not use them.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Expiration:</strong> Boost credits do not expire as long as your account remains active.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7.3 Payment Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    Payments are processed by Apple (App Store), Google Play, or Stripe. The Developer does not store 
                    your credit card details.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>

                </p>

                <h3>8.2 Additional Restrictions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not input "Protected Health Information" (PHI) of <em>other people</em> (e.g., if you are a therapist, do not paste your patient's real names or notes into the Chat).</li>

                        <strong>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, OR DANGER OF SELF-HARM, 
                        STOP USING THIS SERVICE IMMEDIATELY AND CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES:</strong>

                <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 Artificial Intelligence Interaction</h3>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge and agree that <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> is an AI-powered companion system. 
                    You are interacting with machine learning algorithms, not a human being. While the Service 
                    creates a conversational experience that may simulate empathy, these are computational outputs 
                    based on pattern recognition, not human consciousness or professional medical judgment.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 No Medical Advice or Professional Relationship</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-Medical Tool:</strong> The Service is a self-help and wellness tool designed for emotional support, personal reflection, and addiction recovery tracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Professional Relationship:</strong> Your use of the Service does not create a doctor-patient, therapist-client, fiduciary, or confidential professional relationship between you and the Developer or the AI system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not a Substitute:</strong> The Service is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician, psychotherapist, or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Never Delay Care:</strong> Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have read or experienced in this App.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Safety Protocols & Crisis Intervention</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Automated Safety Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    To comply with applicable safety regulations (including California Senate Bill 243), DaddyFreud 
                    employs automated systems designed to detect language indicative of:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suicidal ideation or self-harm</li>
                    <li>Child abuse or exploitation</li>
                    <li>Imminent violence toward others</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Automated Response</h3>
                <p>If the system detects crisis language, it may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interrupt the conversation</li>
                    <li>Provide immediate, clickable resources for crisis hotlines</li>
                    <li>Temporarily suspend the account to prevent reinforcement of harmful patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3 Limitation of Detection Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Natural Language Processing is not infallible. The system cannot 
                    guarantee detection of all crisis situations. You acknowledge that DaddyFreud has no liability 
                    related to the failure of the AI to identify a medical or mental health emergency.
                </p>

                <h2>3. AI Technology & Limitations</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Models</h3>
                <p>
                    The App uses Large Language Models (LLMs) provided by third parties (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, 
                    Anthropic, Google). These are Generative AI systems that create responses based on statistical patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 AI "Hallucinations" and Output Accuracy</h3>
                <p><strong>Critical Limitation:</strong> You understand that Generative AI technology is probabilistic and may produce "hallucinations"—information that sounds plausible but is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Factually incorrect</li>
                    <li>Nonsensical or contradictory</li>
                    <li>Unrelated to your query</li>
                    <li>Potentially harmful if acted upon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> You assume full responsibility for verifying the accuracy of 
                    any information, advice, or suggestions provided by the AI. DaddyFreud makes <strong>no warranty, 
                    express or implied</strong>, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the AI's output. 
                    Reliance on any information provided by the Service is solely at your own risk.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 No Human Oversight</h3>
                <p>
                    Most responses are generated automatically without human review. However, see Section 3.4 below 
                    regarding optional human review in certain circumstances.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Real-Time Corrections by Clinical Reviewers</h3>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that a response you receive may be edited or replaced in real-time by a human 
                    clinical reviewer if you flag it as unhelpful or unsafe. While we aim for clinical quality, the 
                    Developer acts as a platform provider and is not responsible for the specific professional judgment 
                    of these independent reviewers.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Eligibility & Therapist Mode</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Use:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use this App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapist Mode:</strong> Access to "Therapist Mode" is restricted to verified professionals or students who have passed our competency checks. Use of this mode is subject to the additional <strong>Professional User Agreement</strong>. Falsely representing yourself as a clinician to access this mode is a material breach of these Terms and potential fraud.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. User Accounts & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The Developer reserves the right to suspend or delete your account immediately, without notice, if you violate these Terms, specifically regarding safety or abusive content.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                
                <h3>User Content & Model Training</h3>
                <p>You retain ownership of your personal journal entries. However, regarding Chat Interactions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You grant the Developer a license to use your <strong>anonymized</strong> queries and interactions to provide, maintain, and improve the App, including training and developing our AI models.</li>
                    <li>Our clinical reviewers may provide improved responses to help you. These improved responses and associated clinical insights become part of the App's knowledge base.</li>
                    <li>The Developer retains ownership of the App's AI models, algorithms, and anonymized training data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>App Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The interface, code, branding ("DaddyFreud"), and custom system prompts are the intellectual property 
                    of the Developer. You may not reverse-engineer the API or scrape the content.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Subscriptions & Refunds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merchant of Record:</strong> Payments are processed by Apple (App Store) or Stripe. The Developer does not store your credit card details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests must be made directly to the platform (e.g., Apple Support) and are subject to their policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
                <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the App to generate content that promotes self-harm, violence, or illegal acts.</li>
                    <li>Input "Protected Health Information" (PHI) of <em>other people</em> (e.g., if you are a therapist, do not paste your patient's real names or notes into the Chat).</li>
                    <li>Attempt to "jailbreak" the AI to bypass safety filters.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:</strong></p>
                <p>

                <h2>1. The "Airlock" Protocol & Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    You are entering "Therapist Mode" not solely as a user, but as a <strong>Clinical Reviewer</strong>. 
                    The purpose of this mode is to oversee, correct, and improve the AI's responses to users in distress.
                </p>
                <p><strong>The Workflow:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users flag unsatisfactory AI responses.</li>
                    <li>You receive a ticket in the "Airlock."</li>
                    <li>You view an <strong>AI-Generated Summary</strong> of the user's situation (to preserve privacy) and the faulty AI response.</li>
                    <li>You rewrite the response using clinical best practices.</li>
                    <li>Your correction is sent to the user in real-time and added to our "Golden Dataset."</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="document-content">
                <p>
                    This Agreement applies specifically to users who access the <strong>"Therapist Mode"</strong> 
                    features of DaddyFreud. It is an addition to the standard Terms of Service.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Attestation of Competence</h2>
                <p>By activating Therapist Mode, you represent and warrant that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You are a currently licensed mental health professional (e.g., Psychologist, Psychiatrist, LCSW, LPC) OR a student currently enrolled in an accredited graduate mental health program.</li>
                    <li>You have truthfully completed the identity and competency verification steps required by the App.</li>
                    <li><strong>Penalty of Perjury:</strong> You acknowledge that falsely representing yourself as a licensed professional to bypass App safety restrictions constitutes fraud and a violation of this Agreement.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>2. Purpose of "Therapist Mode"</h2>
                <p>Therapist Mode is a <strong>professional development and simulation tool</strong>. It is designed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assist with case conceptualization via AI.</li>
                    <li>Provide advanced clinical terminology and frameworks.</li>
                    <li>Simulate clinical scenarios for training.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>It is NOT a Clinical Medical Device.</strong> It has not been evaluated by the FDA, 
                    EMA, or any regulatory body for clinical use with patients.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Prohibition on Patient Data (HIPAA/GDPR Warning)</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree <strong>NOT</strong> to input Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected 
                    Health Information (PHI) of your real-world patients into the App.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anonymization Required:</strong> If you use the App to conceptualize a real case, you must strictly anonymize the data (e.g., change names, ages, locations, and specific trauma details).</li>
                    <li><strong>Liability:</strong> You maintain sole liability for any privacy breach resulting from your entry of patient data into this third-party AI system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Professional Judgment</h2>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that the App is an automated tool. It creates output based on statistical 
                    patterns, not clinical expertise.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Reliance:</strong> You shall not use the App's output as the primary basis for a diagnosis or treatment plan for any patient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supervision:</strong> You agree to treat AI suggestions with the same skepticism you would apply to a student or peer consultation. The final clinical decision remains 100% yours.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Zahui Varga Erik (the Developer) from any 
                    claims, lawsuits, or damages arising out of:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your use of the App in a professional setting.</li>
                    <li>Any malpractice or liability claim brought against you by a patient where you utilized the App.</li>
                    <li>Your breach of patient confidentiality laws (HIPAA, GDPR) via the App.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>6. Revocation of Access</h2>
                <p>
                    The Developer reserves the right to revoke "Therapist Mode" status at any time, without refund 
                    of verification fees, if we detect:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsafe or unethical behavior.</li>
                    <li>Use of the App to generate harmful content.</li>
                    <li>Suspicious activity indicating the account has been shared or sold.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. No Guarantee of Accuracy</h2>
                <p>
                    The Developer makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or 
                    clinical validity of any AI-generated content in Therapist Mode. Use at your own professional risk.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    This Agreement is governed by the laws of <strong>Romania</strong> and is subject to the 
                    exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in <strong>Bihor County, Romania</strong>.

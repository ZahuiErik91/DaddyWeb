                    <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> ("App") is operated by <strong>Zahui Varga Erik</strong> 
                    ("Developer/We"), based in Romania. For the purposes of the GDPR, the Developer is the 
                    <strong>Data Controller</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We practice <strong>"Data Minimization"</strong> to protect your privacy.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Data We Collect (And Don't Collect)</h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 Anonymous Identifier</h3>
                <p>
                    We generate a random UUID (UserIdentityService) to identify your device. <strong>We do not collect 
                    your email address or phone number</strong> for standard use.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 Chat Content</h3>
                <p>
                    Your messages are processed to generate AI responses. Under GDPR (Article 9), mental health discussions 
                    are <strong>Special Category Data</strong>. By using the App, you explicitly consent to this processing 
                    for the purpose of providing the AI companion service.
                </p>

                <h3>1.3 Emotion Data (Text-Only)</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important:</strong> We analyze your messages using <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> 
                        to detect sentiment (e.g., "Sad", "Happy").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>WE DO NOT USE BIOMETRIC DATA.</strong> We do not record your voice, analyze your facial geometry, 
                        or use "emotion recognition" as defined under the EU AI Act's high-risk categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our AI analyzes the <strong>words you type</strong>, not biological characteristics.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.4 Addiction Tracking Data</h3>
                <p>
                    If you enable sync, encrypted logs of your addiction tracking (e.g., "Relapse Events") are stored in 
                    our secure database (Supabase) tied to your anonymous ID.
                </p>

                <h3>1.5 Conversation State Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We store local data on your device indicating your progression through the App's conversation logic 
                    (e.g., "<strong>Session Count</strong>," "<strong>Distress History</strong>," "<strong>Current State</strong>"). 
                    This data allows the AI to remember context between sessions.
                </p>

                <h3>1.6 Technical Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
                    <li>Crash logs (via Supabase/Apple/Google)</li>
                    <li>IP address (for security and abuse prevention)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Process & Train With Your Data</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 AI Inference (OpenRouter)</h3>
                <p>
                    We use third-party LLMs (e.g., <strong>OpenRouter</strong> routing to Google DeepMind, Google A.I, 
                    Alibaba AI group) to generate immediate responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>These providers are contractually prohibited from training their models on your data.</strong> 
                    However, they may retain logs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring and safety purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Quality Assurance & Training (Human Review)</h3>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    To improve DaddyFreud, a limited subset of <strong>strictly anonymized chat logs</strong> may be 
                    reviewed by our "Clinical Data Specialists" (licensed professionals acting as data analysts).
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    These specialists grade the AI's performance and write better "ideal" responses to train future 
                    versions of the model.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Protection:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We strip all metadata (IPs, Device IDs, UUIDs) before any human sees the text. Analysts see only 
                    the conversation content, not who you are.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Opt-Out:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    You can opt-out of data training in the App Settings. If you opt-out, your chats will only be used 
                    for generating immediate responses, not for improving future AI models.
                </p>

                <h3>2.3 Automated Safety Protocols</h3>
                <p>
                    We use a local algorithm ("<strong>Clinical Engine</strong>") to scan message text for specific 
                    keywords related to self-harm or violence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Effect:</strong> If these keywords are detected, the App's processing logic changes to prioritize safety resources over conversation.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Human Review:</strong> This detection happens locally on your device or via automated script; <strong>no human reads your messages in real-time</strong> to trigger this.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>3. Data Deletion</h2>
                
                <p>You have the right to full data erasure.</p>

                <h3>3.1 How to Delete</h3>
                <p>
                    Go to <strong>Settings → "Delete Account"</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 What Happens</h3>
                <p>This triggers a local DataDeletionService protocol that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wipes your Keychain IDs</li>
                    <li>Deletes all local chat logs and cache</li>
                    <li>Deletes your remote data on Supabase (if found)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Result</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>This action is irreversible.</strong> Because we do not have your email, we <strong>cannot 
                        restore your account</strong> after you click this button.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>

                </ul>

                <h2>5. Third Parties</h2>

                <h3>Research & Development:</h3>
                <p>
                    We may aggregate and de-identify data to support research and development efforts in mental health technology. 
                    This may include sharing anonymized insights with research partners and academic institutions to advance 
                    the field of mental health AI. All such data is stripped of personal identifiers and contains no information 
                    that could reasonably be used to identify you.
                </p>

                    you consent to this transfer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We rely on <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> for data transfers from the EU/UK 
                    to ensure your data remains protected under GDPR standards.

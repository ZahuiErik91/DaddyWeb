                <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> ("App") is a personal project operated by <strong>Zahui Varga Erik</strong> 
                    ("Developer/We"), based in Romania. For the purposes of the GDPR, the Developer is the 
                    <strong>Data Controller</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Special Category Data (Mental Health)</h2>
                <p>
                    The App is designed to help you track sensitive information regarding your mood, addiction 
                    recovery, and mental state. Under GDPR (Article 9), this is <strong>Special Category Data</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>By using the App, you explicitly consent to the processing of this sensitive data for 
                    the sole purpose of providing the tracking and AI coaching services.</strong> You may withdraw 
                    this consent at any time by deleting your account.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 Sensitive Health Data</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Special Category Data:</strong> The contents of your conversations with DaddyFreud, including 
                    discussions about mental health, addiction recovery, and emotional wellbeing, are classified as 
                    <strong>Sensitive Personal Data</strong> under GDPR Article 9 and similar regulations. We collect 
                    this data only with your explicit, opt-in consent for the purpose of providing the therapy support service.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Other Data Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address, username, password (encrypted).</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Chat logs, journal entries, sobriety clocks, mood ratings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity Verification Data:</strong> If you apply for "Therapist Mode," we may collect proof of ID or professional licensure via secure third-party processors (e.g., Stripe Identity). We do not store raw ID images after verification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, device model, browser type, crash logs (via Supabase/Apple).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Biometric Data Exclusion (EU AI Act Compliance)</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important Clarification:</strong> DaddyFreud utilizes <strong>text-based Natural Language 
                        Processing (NLP)</strong> to understand sentiment and emotional context from the semantic content 
                        of your messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>We DO NOT collect, store, or process:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Voiceprints or voice biometric templates</li>
                        <li>Facial geometry or facial recognition data</li>
                        <li>Keystroke dynamics or typing rhythm patterns</li>
                        <li>Any other biometric identifiers for emotion recognition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Our AI analyzes the <strong>words you type</strong>, not biological or behavioral characteristics. 
                        This approach ensures we are not classified as a "biometric emotion recognition system" under 
                        the EU AI Act.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Third-Party AI Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    To function, the AI sends your chat text to <strong>OpenRouter</strong> 
                    (which routes to models like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or Google Gemini).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Training by Third Parties:</strong> We have configured our API settings to request that these providers <strong>DO NOT</strong> use your data to train their models. However, they may retain logs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We send only the conversation history necessary for the immediate context.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2 AI Model Training & Improvement (Opt-In Only)</h3>
                <p><strong>Default State:</strong> Your chat logs are <strong>NOT</strong> used to train our AI models by default. They are used solely to generate responses in your active session.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Opt-In for Service Improvement:</strong> You may choose to opt-in to help improve DaddyFreud. If you do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your conversation logs will be <strong>de-identified</strong> (all personal identifiers stripped)</li>
                    <li>Anonymized data may be used to fine-tune our models for better accuracy and empathy</li>
                    <li>You can revoke this consent at any time in Settings</li>
                    <li>Upon revocation, your data will be removed from future training sets (though it cannot be removed from models already trained)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4-B. Quality Improvement & Human Review</h3>
                <p>
                    While most interactions are fully automated, we employ a human review system to improve clinical safety and service quality.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When It Happens:</strong> If you flag a response as unhelpful or unsafe, or if our automated systems detect a complex scenario, the interaction may be queued for review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> A verified clinical reviewer may view an <strong>anonymized summary</strong> of your situation. They do not see your raw chat logs, name, or other personal identifiers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Support:</strong> The reviewer may provide an improved response to better support you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Anonymized interaction patterns and corrected responses help us train and improve future versions of our AI models. This process is similar to how other AI services improve over time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> User data is stored securely using <strong>Supabase</strong> (servers located in the EU/US).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Where possible, logic is handled locally on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell your <strong>personal identifiable data</strong>. We share data with the following parties:</p>
                
                <h3>Infrastructure Providers:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>OpenRouter:</strong> For AI text generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For database hosting and authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stripe/Apple:</strong> For payment processing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Research & Development:</h3>
                <p>
                    We may aggregate and de-identify data to support research and development efforts in mental health technology. 
                    This may include sharing anonymized insights with research partners and academic institutions to advance 
                    the field of mental health AI. All such data is stripped of personal identifiers and contains no information 
                    that could reasonably be used to identify you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are located in the EEA, note that some of our processors (e.g., OpenRouter, Stripe) 
                    are based in the USA. We rely on the <strong>Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</strong> or 
                    <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> to ensure your data remains protected.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law.

                    within 30 days.
                </p>

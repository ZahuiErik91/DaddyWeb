                <p>
                    <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> ("App") is operated by <strong>Zahui Varga Erik</strong> 
                    ("Developer/We"), based in Romania. For the purposes of the GDPR, the Developer is the 
                    <strong>Data Controller</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We practice <strong>"Data Minimization"</strong> to protect your privacy.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Data We Collect (And Don't Collect)</h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 Anonymous Identifier</h3>
                <p>
                    We generate a random UUID (UserIdentityService) to identify your device. <strong>We do not collect 
                    your email address or phone number</strong> for standard use.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2 Chat Content</h3>
                <p>
                    Your messages are processed to generate AI responses. Under GDPR (Article 9), mental health discussions 
                    are <strong>Special Category Data</strong>. By using the App, you explicitly consent to this processing 
                    for the purpose of providing the AI companion service.
                </p>

                <h3>1.3 Emotion Data (Text-Only)</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important:</strong> We analyze your messages using <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> 
                        to detect sentiment (e.g., "Sad", "Happy").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>WE DO NOT USE BIOMETRIC DATA.</strong> We do not record your voice, analyze your facial geometry, 
                        or use "emotion recognition" as defined under the EU AI Act's high-risk categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our AI analyzes the <strong>words you type</strong>, not biological characteristics.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>1.4 Addiction Tracking Data</h3>
                <p>
                    If you enable sync, encrypted logs of your addiction tracking (e.g., "Relapse Events") are stored in 
                    our secure database (Supabase) tied to your anonymous ID.
                </p>

                <h3>1.5 Technical Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
                    <li>Crash logs (via Supabase/Apple/Google)</li>
                    <li>IP address (for security and abuse prevention)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Process Your Data</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 AI Inference (OpenRouter)</h3>
                <p>
                    Your anonymized message text is sent to third-party AI providers (e.g., <strong>Google DeepMind, 
                    Google A.I, Alibaba AI group</strong>) via <strong>OpenRouter</strong> solely to generate a response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>These providers are contractually prohibited from training their models on your data.</strong> 
                    However, they may retain logs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring and safety purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Cloud Sync (Supabase)</h3>
                <p>
                    If you enable sync, encrypted logs of your addiction tracking (e.g., "Relapse Events") are stored 
                    in our secure database (<strong>Supabase</strong>) tied to your anonymous ID.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256)</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Supabase servers are located in the EU/US</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Data Deletion ("The Nuke Button")</h2>
                
                <p>You have the right to full data erasure.</p>

                <h3>3.1 How to Delete</h3>
                <p>
                    Go to <strong>Settings → "Delete Account"</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 What Happens</h3>
                <p>This triggers a local DataDeletionService protocol that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wipes your Keychain IDs</li>
                    <li>Deletes all local chat logs and cache</li>
                    <li>Deletes your remote data on Supabase (if found)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Result</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>This action is irreversible.</strong> Because we do not have your email, we <strong>cannot 
                        restore your account</strong> after you click this button.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>4. Quality Improvement & Human Review (Optional)</h2>
                
                <p>
                    While most interactions are fully automated, we employ a human review system to improve clinical safety and service quality.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When It Happens:</strong> If you flag a response as unhelpful or unsafe, the interaction may be queued for review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> A verified clinical reviewer may view an <strong>anonymized summary</strong> of your situation. They do not see your raw chat logs, name, or other personal identifiers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Support:</strong> The reviewer may provide an improved response.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Anonymized interaction patterns help us train and improve future AI models.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> User data is stored securely using <strong>Supabase</strong> (servers located in the EU/US).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Where possible, logic is handled locally on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell your <strong>personal identifiable data</strong>. We share data with the following parties:</p>
                
                <h3>Infrastructure Providers:</h3>
                <ol>

                <h3>Research & Development:</h3>
                <p>
                    We may aggregate and de-identify data to support research and development efforts in mental health technology. 
                    This may include sharing anonymized insights with research partners and academic institutions to advance 
                    the field of mental health AI. All such data is stripped of personal identifiers and contains no information 
                    that could reasonably be used to identify you.
                </p>

                </p>

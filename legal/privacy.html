                <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>DaddyFreud</strong> ("App") is a personal project operated by <strong>Zahui Varga Erik</strong> 
                    ("Developer/We"), based in Romania. For the purposes of the GDPR, the Developer is the 
                    <strong>Data Controller</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Special Category Data (Mental Health)</h2>
                <p>
                    The App is designed to help you track sensitive information regarding your mood, addiction 
                    recovery, and mental state. Under GDPR (Article 9), this is <strong>Special Category Data</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>By using the App, you explicitly consent to the processing of this sensitive data for 
                    the sole purpose of providing the tracking and AI coaching services.</strong> You may withdraw 
                    this consent at any time by deleting your account.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voluntary Data:</strong> Chat logs, journal entries, sobriety clocks, mood ratings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity Verification Data:</strong> If you apply for "Therapist Mode," we may collect proof of ID or professional licensure via secure third-party processors (e.g., Stripe Identity). We do not store raw ID images after verification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP address, device model, crash logs (via Supabase/Apple).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. How We Use AI (Third-Party Processing)</h2>
                <p>
                    To function, the "AI Coach" sends your anonymized chat text to <strong>OpenRouter</strong> 
                    (which routes to models like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or Google Gemini).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Training:</strong> We have configured our API settings to request that these providers <strong>DO NOT</strong> use your data to train their models. However, they may retain logs for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We send only the conversation history necessary for the immediate context.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4-B. Human Review & The "Airlock" System (Golden Dataset)</h3>
                <p>
                    While most interactions are fully automated, we employ a "Human-in-the-Loop" system to improve clinical safety.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Trigger:</strong> If you flag a response as unhelpful, unsafe, or if our automated safety systems detect a complex clinical scenario, the interaction may be queued for review.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Process (The Airlock):</strong> A verified clinical reviewer (Therapist) may view an <strong>anonymized summary</strong> of your situation. They DO NOT see your raw chat logs, name, or personal identifiers.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The reviewer may rewrite the AI's response in real-time to provide better support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> The corrected response and the anonymized scenario are added to our "Golden Dataset" to train future versions of our AI. By using the App, you acknowledge that your anonymized interaction patterns contribute to this medical training data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Data Storage & Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> User data is stored securely using <strong>Supabase</strong> (servers located in the EU/US).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Where possible, logic is handled locally on your device.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell your <strong>personal identifiable data</strong>. We share data with the following parties:</p>

                    <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For database hosting and authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stripe/Apple:</strong> For payment processing.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    We may aggregate and strictly anonymize data (stripping all personal identifiers) to create clinical datasets. 
                    These <strong>anonymous</strong> datasets may be licensed or sold to research institutions or healthcare companies 
                    for the purpose of advancing mental health AI. These datasets contain no information that could reasonably 
                    be used to identify you.
                </p>

                    are based in the USA. We rely on the <strong>Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</strong> or 
                    <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> to ensure your data remains protected.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>

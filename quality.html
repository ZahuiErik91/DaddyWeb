                <h2>1. Purpose of Engagement</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree to serve as a <strong>Clinical Data Specialist</strong> (or "Quality Analyst") for DaddyFreud. 
                    Your role is strictly limited to evaluating, grading, and refining Artificial Intelligence (AI) outputs 
                    and generating synthetic training data ("Golden Data").
                </p>

                <h2>2. No Doctor-Patient Relationship</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Non-Clinical Role</h3>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that you are <strong>NOT providing medical care, psychotherapy, or counseling services</strong> 
                    to any end-user of the DaddyFreud App.
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 No Direct Contact</h3>
                <p>
                    You shall have <strong>no direct contact</strong> with App users. Your interaction is limited to the 
                    review of anonymized text logs or the generation of hypothetical therapeutic responses.
                </p>

                <h3>2.3 Status</h3>
                <p>
                    You are an <strong>independent contractor providing technical data services</strong>, not a healthcare 
                    provider acting in a clinical capacity.
                </p>

                    If you are presented with user data for review, it will be <strong>stripped of direct identifiers</strong>

                <h2>5. Independent Contractor Relationship</h2>
                
                <h3>5.1 Relationship of Parties</h3>
                <p>
                    You are an <strong>independent business entity</strong> and not an employee, partner, agent, or 
                    franchisee of DaddyFreud.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 Autonomy and Control</h3>
                <p>You retain sole discretion to determine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> When and for how long you work on data annotation tasks</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> How you approach grading and generating responses (within quality guidelines)</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> The right to accept or reject any task without penalty</li>

                <p>
                    You are expressly permitted to provide similar data annotation services to other companies,

                <h2>5. Access to Clinical Tools ("Therapist Mode")</h2>
                
                <h3>5.1 Tool Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are granted access to debug tools, "Therapist Mode," or the "Clinical Engine" dashboard, 
                    you agree to use these <strong>strictly for data generation and quality assurance purposes</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These tools are designed to help you evaluate AI outputs and create training data. They are not 
                    intended for personal use or self-therapy.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 Data Integrity & Access Revocation</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> DaddyFreud reserves the right to revoke your access to clinical 
                        tools at any time to maintain <strong>data integrity</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Automatic Switching to Standard Mode:</strong> If our automated safety systems detect that 
                    you are using the App for personal support (rather than professional analysis), your session will 
                    be automatically flagged as "<strong>Personal Use</strong>" rather than "<strong>Work Product</strong>."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Effect:</strong> When this occurs, the system will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temporarily switch you to the standard user interface</li>
                    <li>Disable access to analyst tools and dashboards</li>
                    <li>Prioritize providing you with appropriate support resources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rationale:</strong> This policy exists to protect the quality and objectivity of training 
                    data. Work product created during personal distress may not meet the objectivity standards required 
                    for AI model training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Restoration:</strong> Access to analyst tools may be restored after your personal support 
                    session concludes, subject to management review.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Quality Standards</h2>
                
                <h3>6.1 Professional Expertise</h3>
                <p>
                    While you are not providing clinical services, you represent that you possess relevant clinical 
                    expertise (e.g., licensed therapist, psychology graduate student) to evaluate the quality of 
                    mental health-related AI responses.
                </p>

                <h3>6.2 Safety Guidelines</h3>
                <p>
                    When grading or creating responses, prioritize safety:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flag any AI output that recommends self-harm or suicide</li>
                    <li>Ensure crisis resources (hotlines) are included in high-risk scenarios</li>
                    <li>Follow evidence-based therapeutic frameworks (CBT, DBT, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Platform Neutrality:</strong> DaddyFreud provides the technology platform to facilitate 
                    data annotation. DaddyFreud does not practice medicine or provide healthcare services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that your Deliverables may be used to train AI systems that interact with vulnerable 
                    populations. However, <strong>DaddyFreud bears no liability</strong> for how end-users interpret or 
                    act upon AI-generated responses based on models trained with your data.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Termination & Revocation</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time. DaddyFreud may revoke your access if your 
                    Deliverables are deemed low-quality, unsafe, or inconsistent with guidelines.

                <h3>8.1 Automatic Termination for Mental Health Crisis</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p>
                        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you use DaddyFreud as a patient (not as an analyst) and our AI 
                        safety systems flag you for suicidal ideation, self-harm, or critical mental health distress, 
                        your analyst access will be <strong>immediately and automatically terminated</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This policy exists to protect both you and the users whose data you review. We cannot permit 
                        individuals in acute mental health crisis to grade sensitive mental health data or generate 
                        clinical training responses.
                    </p>
                </div>
